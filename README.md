## Installation (manual)

You need the [pre-configured BepInEx pack](https://stacklands.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Stacklands) for this mod. If you installed BepInEx from a different place, you will need to edit the config files.

Extract the contents of this folder to `Stacklands/BepInEx/plugins/VillagerNames`. The final folder layout should look like this:
```
plugins/
  VillagerNames/
    VillagerNames.dll
    icon.png
    manifest.json
    README.md
```

## Known bugs

- Keybinds still work while typing in the text field (this is a vanilla bug, not caused by the mod)
- Renamed babies don't keep the name when they grow into villagers

## Troubleshooting

This mod affects your save files minimally, it adds an ExtraData property to renamed villagers, which are easy to modify manually if something goes wrong
